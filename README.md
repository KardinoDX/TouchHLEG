# TouchHLEG: A Graphical Launcher for [touchHLE](https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE)

![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126808671/223121839-1338d2db-73ca-4eb7-92b4-08d9b52cec5b.PNG)

# Requirements

1. The Latest release of [touchHLE](https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE)
2. [Microsoft .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
3. The latest release of touchHLEG

# Usage
First, make sure you have .NET 6.0 installed. Next, extract touchHLE and touchHLEG into the same folder. **IT IS IMPROTANT THAT THEY ARE IN THE SAME FOLDER OR ELSE THE LAUNCHER WILL NOT WORK!**

Next, simply open the Launcher, choose your IPA file and settings, then click "Launch." Easy-Peasy!

# Notes
1. The program may work with previous versions of .NET but I haven't tested it so no guarentees.
2. As touchHLE supports more games, I will try to keep the launcher updated too. It should be a somewhat simple process with how I set it up.
3. I will try to keep feature parody with the emulator as applicable. But this is just a temporary, personal project until touchHLE gains a proper GUI.
4. Finally, of course credit goes to Hikari-no-yume for making the actual emulator
